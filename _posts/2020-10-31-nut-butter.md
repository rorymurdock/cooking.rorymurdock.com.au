You can make all kinds of butters, almond, cashew, hazelnut and it process is about the same for them all.

You can mix in various chocolates, chia seeds, flex seeds, maple syrup, and more.

Just put the nuts in the blender and go, if it's too thick just blend for longer. Be careful not to overheat or burn out your blender though!

This possibly my favorite sauce every

For my birthday one year my friend Jon gifted me a jar of this sauce and I've loved it ever since. He recently shared the recipe and I've made several jars of it since. It goes great with eggs, pizza, chicken, pretty much everything.

You can substitute the Chipotle in adobo with some Chipotle Morita for a smokier taste
